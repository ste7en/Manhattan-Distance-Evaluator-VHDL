## Digital Systems Design project

This is a VHDL implementation of a digital circuit that evaluates which points (centroids) are closer to a given point.
It is a part of the course **Reti Logiche** (aka Digital Systems) and one of the three final projects for the BSc in Engineering of Computing Systems at **Politecnico di Milano**.
